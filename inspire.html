    <p>"Women belong in <strong>ALL</strong> places where decisions are being made." -Ruth Bader Ginsburg</p>
    <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a Justice on the supreme court, who was known as a "feminist icon". RBG was the second women to be appointed to the supreme court and during her life time, she would fight for equality in the court room.</p>
<p>RBG inspires me everyday, because she knew what changes she wanted to make and fought hard to make sure that women were treated fairly in society. Motivated, Hardworking, and passionate are three words to describe RBG. She was the voice on the Supreme Court, for millions of women in th U.S. who wanted to fight for gender equalitiy. Ruth acheived many accomplishments throughout her life and she will always be known as one of the most important activists for womens rights in the United States.</p>
