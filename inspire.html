    <p>"Women belong in <strong>all</strong> places where decisions are being made." -Ruth Bader Ginsburg</p>
    <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a Justice on the supreme court, who was known as a "feminist icon". RBG was the second women to be appointed to the supreme court and during her life time, she would fight for equality.</p>
<p>RBG inspires me everyday, because she knew what changes she wanted to make and fought hard to make sure that women were treated fairly in society.</p>
