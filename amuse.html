    <h1>Three Pages on the Internet That Amuse Me</h1>
    <h3>By Katie Marler</h3>
    <p>These are my top three resources that I go to when I need some cheering up. Hopefully, they cheer you up when you are feeling down.</p>
    <h2>Top Dog and Puppy Fails</h2>
    <p>This video is all about dogs and how sometimes they can get themselves into quite some hilarious situations. I love dogs and I think it is funny to watch them get into trouble and get into some mischief. I hope you enjoy this video as much as I do!</p>

    <h2>Good ol' Reddit</h2>
    <p>Reddit is a place where many people can find their own social groups online or hear funny stories. I really enjoy reading reddit and hopefully you like this subreddit page as well!</p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funnystories/">r/FunnyStories</a>
    <h2>The Useless Web</h2>
    <p>Ever been stuck at home and so bored you do not even know what to do? Well this website will help you discover the most useless pages on the internet! One click and it will take you to a useless webpage. Some web pages include games or useless information. The internet is endless!</p>
